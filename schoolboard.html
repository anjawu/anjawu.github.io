	<!-- <br/> -->
	<p>
		As a teacher it is impossible to not pull trends occurring in your class and extrapolate it, even though it is a small sample size. Oftentimes we don’t use data to check if our feelings are correct but I found an <a href="https://www.app.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/bpr/searchBoard.asp" class="saymore">open source dataset from the Ontario government</a> that looks at the school boards across Ontario and their reading EQAO/OSSLT for 2018/2019, four- and five-year graduation rates and compares progress in each category since 2017/2018. Interestingly, they do not include the math results (missing both grade 6 and 9). So I jumped on the opportunity to try to answer some questions I had.

<!-- Questions -->
<div class="row">
	<h4 id="questions"><center>Questions</center></h4>
	<p>
		<a href="#q1" class="saymore">Question 1</a>: What school board is the best at standardized testing, credit accumulation, and graduation rates?
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>
				Consistently the same school board should appear across all three categories; if not, this tells us there is something going on in either how standardized tests are being run or how schools are giving credits.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="#q2" class="saymore">Question 2</a>: Are there certain demographics that did better in 2018/2019 <i>(referred to as 2019)</i>?
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>
				Look at grade 6 vs 10 reading scores
			</li>
			<li>
				Look at board type (Public vs Catholic) and language (English vs French)
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="#q3" class="saymore">Question 3</a>: The general consensus is that progress and achievement is getting worse year by year. We can use this data to see if in fact there is a general pattern of decrease in progress since 2017/2018 (referred to as 2018). Are there certain grades/demographics that did the worse in comparison to 2017/2018? 
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>
				Look at the average across EQAO progress variables (grade 6 and 10)
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>for each school (plot each schools progress)</li>
					<li>Average the average: general, Catholic vs Public, English vs French</li>

			</li>
			<li>
				Look at four year graduation rates 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="#q4" class="saymore">Question 4</a>: Does a higher literacy test score indicate a potentially higher credit accumulation? In order to make sure we are following the same students, we need to compare the following metrics:
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>
				Checking to see if the same age group has similar credit accumulation year over year: Grade 10 credit accumulation 2018 compared to Grade 11 credit accumulation 2019
			</li>
			<li>
				Grade 10 literacy to grade 10 credit accumulation
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>2018</li>
					<li>2019</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Grade 10 literacy 2018 to grade 11 credit accumulation 2019
			</li>
			<li>
				Check correlation coefficients
			</li>
			<li>
				Plot scatterplots
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="#q5" class="saymore">Question 5</a>: How much does being on track in credits in grade 11 affect graduation rates? 
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Grade 11 credit accumulation 2018 to four year grad rate 2019</li>
			<li>Check correlation coefficient </li>
			<li>Plot scatterplot</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="#q6" class="saymore">Question 6</a>: Are there certain locational trends for school achievement? 
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Plot by city</li>
			<li>Look at average of 2018 and 2019 for EQAO/OSSLT </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<!-- 	<p>

		<b><i>*Note: for all questions I am not referring to the percentage of individual student but rather the percentage of students that passed the predefined features (e.g. grade 10 credit accumulation: percentage of students who have at least 16 credits by the end of grade 10, grade 10 OSSLT: percentage of students who passed the literacy test)</i></b>

<div class="row">
	<h4 id="analysis"><center>Analysis</center></h4>
	<h5 id="q1"><center>Question 1) What school board is the best at standardized testing, credit accumulation, and graduation rates?</center></h5>	
	<center><a href="#questions"><i>back to questions</i></a></center>
	<p>
		Highest percentage of students passing the standardized test:
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q1_best_standardized_school.png" width="900" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
		Highest credit accumulation:
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q1_best_credit_school.png" width="900" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
		Highest four year graduation rate:
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q1_best_grad_rate_school.png" width="900" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		As can be seen there is a different school board for each category. This implies more digging would need to be done; this would include looking on a more granular level such as schools within each school board. There could be certain schools that do either a really good job or a poor job in each category which would greatly change the average. The dashboard has an interactive tool that you can cross-reference which type of school boards you want to compare.
	</p>
	<p>
		I compared the two different types cross referenced with the two different languages and I found that only for one combination did one school board become the best for all three categories. The York Region DSB was the only school board to appear across all three categories when the filters were for Public English school boards.

	<!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="row">
	<h5 id="q2"><center>Question 2) Are there certain demographics that did better in 2018/2019 (referred to as 2019)?</center></h5>	
	<center><a href="#questions"><i>back to questions</i></a></center>
	<p>
		<i><b>Note</b>: For the purposes of this analysis, the number comparisons will be considered statistically significant: because each school board has a lot of students and we are looking at 72 school boards, this would give us a large “n” meaning that our standard error is very small.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Grade 6 reading scores tended to be better than grade 10, on average across all school boards. There is a significant difference of 3%. A couple of explanations: we are not preparing our students as well in grade 10 as we do in grade 6, or the standardized test is not as well structured for grade 11 as it is for grade 6.
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q2_6-10_eqao_2019_avg.png" width="300" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		For EQAO achievement, credit progress and graduation rates, the public board (compared to catholic) on average is lower for all for 2018/2019 by a substantial amount (close to 10%). The English board (compared to French) is also lower in all categories - by a substantial amount (10+%).

		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q2_english_french_comp.png" width="650" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Further breakdown shows that the Public English schools perform the worst, while the French Catholic schools perform best.
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q2_language_type_comp.png" width="750" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is interesting to note, for the Public board school the EQAO scores on avg are approximately the same as the credit accumulation rate. For the Catholic board, it seems like the EQAO scores were lower than the credit accumulation rate. One more very interesting finding is that the Public French board is the only one to have a higher four year grad rate compared to the credit accumulation rate (by over 5%). All other boards decreased by at least 1% up to 3%.
	</p>
	<h6>Conclusion:</h6>
	<ul class="disc">
		<li>Grade 6 students performed better than grade 10 students</li>
		<li>French Catholic performed best in all categories</li>
		<li>English Public performed worst in all categories</li>

					<div class="tab">
						*Public board did worse than Catholic (similar to what was seen in 2019)<br>
						*Interesting to note: credits were on average given MORE often when OSSLT scores were LOWER. <i>This could be because OSSLT evaluation is not a good coverage of material from curriculum or maybe school boards are more likely to give out credits or could be a mix of both.</i><br>
						*The Public board has a lot more people graduating, while the Catholic board did not change much year-over-year (even though the Catholic school board had high credit accumulation rates)

						*The English boards tended to be more likely to give credits than the French boards<br>
						*English boards increased in credit accumulation even though a decrease in OSSLT progress, whereas the French board saw a decrease in credit accumulation. We would expect a decrease in OSSLT scores to lead to a decrease in grade 10 credit accumulation due to the OSSLT being given in grade 10

						*All school boards did worse on the grade 10 OSSLT (by a very large percentage 1.3 to 4.5%)<br>
						*Within the public board, English did better in the OSSLT than French and had more credits given (even though there was a decrease in score for OSSLT from previous year). The four year graduation progress was higher. Interesting to note is that the French EQAO scores were worse than 2017/2018 AND there was a decrease in credits given (as one would expect)<br>
						*Within the Catholic board, the English did better as well on OSSLT than French, and also gave more credits.

			</ul>

	</ul><br>
	<p>
		Overall the trend is opposite of what I would have expected; lower score but higher credit accumulation:

	<h6>Conclusion:</h6>
	<p>
		From 2018 to 2019:
		<ul class="disc">

			<li>Worse grade 10 OSSLT scores</li>
			<li>Higher rates of credits given</li>
			<li>Higher rates of four year graduation</li>

	<center><a href="#questions"><i>back to questions</i></a></center>

	<h6>Grade 10 credit accumulation (2018) to Grade 11 credit accumulation (2019)</h6>
	<p>
		Looking at the same group of students (grade 10 in 2018 then grade 11 in 2019), we can see, on average, more than 3.5% difference in credit accumulation for the same group of students year over year: 
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q4_gr10_2018-gr11_2019_credit_table.png" width="400" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
		Meaning that more students reach the complete credit threshold by end of grade 11 (min. 23 credits) than the end of grade 10 credit threshold (min. 16 credits).
	</p>
	<p>
		We also see a positive trend in the data, with some significant outliers. With the Pearson correlation coefficient being 0.69043059991308764, implying there is a moderate positive correlation between the percentage of students who get 16 or more credits by the end of grade 10 and the percentage of students who get 23 or more credits by the end of grade 11.

		We also see a positive trend in the data, with only one major outlier. With the Pearson correlation coefficient being 0.62613743522943011, implying there is only a moderate positive correlation between the percentage of students who passed the literacy test in 2018 and the percentage of students who get 16 or more credits by the end of grade 10 in 2018.

	<h6>Grade 10 credit accumulation to OSSLT (2019)</h6>
	<p>
		For 2019, the average percentage of students to pass the OSSLT and get at least 16 credits by the end of grade 10 was different by 2%:

	</p>
	<p>
		We also see a slight positive trend in the data, with some significant outliers. With the Pearson correlation coefficient being 0.52517260306175906, implying there is a low to moderate positive correlation between the percentage of students who passed the OSSLT in 2019 and the percentage of students who got 16 or more credits by the end of grade 10 in 2019.

		Out of curiosity, using the dashboard I looked into the different board type and language permutations of the 2018 and 2019 average of OSSLT and grade 10 credit accumulation. I found that the French Catholic School Boards had the opposite pattern of all other school boards: as the percentage of students who passed the OSSLT increased, the percentage of students who got at least 16 credits by the end of grade 10 actually decreased.<br>
		Here are the correlations I calculated<br>
		<center>
			Overall: 0.674<br>
			French Catholic SBs: -0.792<br>
			English Catholic SBs: 0.221<br>
			French Public SBs: 0.783<br>
			English Public SBs: 0.696

	<h6>OSSLT 2018 to grade 11 credit 2019</h6>
	<p>
		Looking at the same group of students (grade 10 OSSLT in 2018 then grade 11 credit accumulation in 2019), we can see, on average, about 3% difference for the same group of students year over year: 
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q4_gr10_OSSLT_2018-gr11_credit_2019_table.png" width="400" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
		Meaning that more students reach the complete credit threshold by end of grade 11 (min. 23 credits) than the percentage of students who pass the literacy test (OSSLT).
	</p>
	<p>
		We also see a positive trend in the data, with few outliers. With the Pearson correlation coefficient being 0.74480333233145657, implying there is a strong positive correlation between the percentage of students who pass the literacy test and the percentage of students who get 23 or more credits by the end of grade 11.

					There seemed to be several schools that appeared in a couple instances of outliers.
					<ul class="disc">
						<li><b>Renfrew County CDSB</b> had a high percentage of students who passed the OSSLT and had at least 23 credits at the end of grade 11 but a low percentage of students who had at least 16 credits by the end of grade 10. This could be an indicator that there might be something wrong with the data point of grade 10 credit accumulation, or there could be something to check out about their process of grade 10 credits given.</li>
						<li><b>Northeastern CDSB</b> had a low percentage of students passing the OSSLT and getting at least 16 credits by the end of grade 10 but a high percentage of students who had at least 23 credits by the end of grade 11. This could be an indicator of bad data or some more digging should be dug into how students are being given credits in grade 11.</li>
						<li><b>Keewatin-Patricia DSB</b> seems to have a high percentage of students being on track for credits in grade 10 and 11 but a low percentage of students passing the OSSLT. It would be interesting to dig deeper into why their students are not doing better on the literacy test.</li>

	<!-- Question 5 -->

	<h5 id="q5"><center>Question 5) How much does being on track in credits in grade 11 affect graduation rates? </center></h5>	
	<center><a href="#questions"><i>back to questions</i></a></center>
	<p>
		Based on the data we have, it would seem that the credit accumulation in grade 11 is a very good indicator of the four year graduation rate.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can see that the percentage is fairly similar (off by less than 1%):
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q5_gr11_2018-four_year_grad_2019.png" width="350" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
		And we can see that it has a positive trend:
		<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q5_gr11_2018-four_year_grad_2019_graph.png" width="450" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
		With a Pearson correlation coefficient of ~0.88.
	</p>
	<p>
		There were two outliers:
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Renfrew County CDSB had a low percentage (47%) of students who had at least 23 credits by the end of grade 11 but a higher percentage (66.5%) of students who graduated within 4 years.</li>
			<li>DSB Ontario North East had a higher percentage (60%) of students who had at least 23 credits by the end of grade 11 but a lower percentage (53.4%) of students who graduated within 4 years.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h6>Conclusion:</h6>
	<ul class="disc">
		<li>Percentage of student on track with at least 23 credits by the end of grade 11 is a very good indicator of percentage of students who graduate within 4 years.</li>

	<center><a href="#questions"><i>back to questions</i></a></center>
	<p>
	Looking at the standardized testing average (including years 2018 and 2019 for more data points) we can see that Ottawa and Toronto tend to do better than other cities. Usually the more rural a town is the more likely the school board has performed more poorly.
	<center><img src="images/pages/projects/schoolboard/q6_standardized_test_avg.png" width="800" height=”auto” alt=""></center><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		We saw that overall the grade 6 scores were better than grade 10, so looking at just a focus on the average grade 10 scores (2018 and 2019), we can see a similar trend as above holds.
