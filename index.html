			Hi, my name is Anja! I have a love of learning and am pursuing my passion in data. I have been self-motivated to improve my skills and apply my learnings to real-life data with the hopes to produce actionable insights for things I am passionate about. I have been learning <b>Python</b> (including <b>Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, sci kit-learn, statsmodels, SciPy, Folium, Selenium</b>), <b>SQL</b> (using <b>Mode</b> and <b>BigQuery</b>), <b>Looker Studio</b>, and <b>Google Analytics</b>. I have also completed a Vector Institute's 6-week <b>Machine Learning</b> course covering: k-NN, decision trees, regression, and feed-forward neural networks. As a teacher, I have a great deal of experience in clearly communicating to all levels of math/data literacy and a love of passing on my passion for STEM.

			 During my coding (and data analysis) journey I had begun documenting how I was learning stuff as I was doing projects and research. I wanted to learn how to not only analyze data but also get it - so most of the projects I have done thus far have been about web scraping and my latest finally gets into a deep data analysis. So initially this website was primarily about using Python, but I started using SQL and have really enjoyed it thus far. This webpage contains what I have learnt - written in a way that was supposed to help me learn and reflect on my learning - so I often go on tangents about errors I had to try to solve for and research I had to do to complete a project. I also link to a lot of good resources from the people I have learnt from. And I include my final code linked via GitHub.
			 <br> <br>
			 How to navigate this website you ask? The pages contain a drop down menu to try to further organize my thoughts, plus the Projects page has a summary of each project with technologies used and skills learnt. Breakdown of what you will find:

		<!-- New  Listing for Coding Info!-->
		<h4>Coding Information</h4>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>
				<h5><a href="sql.html" class="saymore">SQL</a></h5> 
					Mode reports using Yammer data; looking at a drop in engagement, understanding search functionality, and analyzing A/B test results. Also contains syntax (beginner to advanced) I have learnt using SQL.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="ganalytics.html" class="saymore">Google Data</a></h5>
					Setting up Google Analytics to monitor visitors to this website. Then I wanted an easier way to visualize my most important data points (number of visitors, time on each page, and location of visitors) rather than having to click through so many tabs on the Google Analytics platform, so I made a dashboard with Looker Studio. I wanted a way to practice SQL but with my own data sets, so I started using BigQuery and writing my tips down. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="libraries.html" class="saymore">Python Libraries</a></h5>
					Details about functions and tricks I have used from specific Python libraries: statsmodels, SciPy, imbalance-learn, scikit-learn, NLTK/spaCy, Folium, Seaborn, matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and Selenium.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="stats.html" class="saymore">Statistics</a></h5>
				 I took some courses online through Harvard University for Statistics and R in Data Science. This page goes through a summary of the various statistics and coding knowledge gained.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="ml.html" class="saymore">Machine Learning</a></h5>
					The <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/mothers-and-machine-learning/" >Vector Institute course for Machine Learning</a> was 6 weeks, and I summarized all the materials and my assignments (along with GitHub code links).
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="github.html" class="saymore">GitHub</a></h5>
					Step instructions for my common actions using git from terminal.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="funlearn.html" class="saymore">Fun Things Learnt</a></h5>
					I decided to make this section for two main reasons: 1) I wanted to write down new things that I had learnt that I haven’t had a chance to try out in a big project and 2) by having to type out what I learnt it prevented me from going down too many rabbit holes and really zeroing in on what I was trying to figure out.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="versus.html" class="saymore">Versus</a></h5>
					Like with learning new languages, there are plenty of words that seem similar but are different and you mix them up for whatever reason, this is what this section is for me.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="environmentsetup.html" class="saymore">Environment Setup</a></h5>
					In this section, I go over how I set up my computer environments.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="six columns">
		<h4><a href="projects.html" class="saymore"> Projects </a></h4>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>
				<h5><a href="redlight.html" class="saymore">Red Light</a> &#128678; <span style="font-size: 14px"><i>(Python)</i></span></h5> 
					When I was driving into downtown for work during the later part of COVID I noticed that the traffic still seemed to be a lot lighter than before. So I was curious what has changed on the roads. When I looked on the City of Ottawa open source data, I got very excited to see that they have data from red light violations from 2016-2020. So I used the open source red light camera violations from the City of Ottawa website to do an in-depth analysis of when and where the highest number of violations occur in order to give suggestions on next steps for the City of Ottawa planning new redlight traffic lights. There was the 2021 dataset added after I finished the report, so I went back and got new insights from 2016-2021.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="costco.html" class="saymore">Costco</a> &#128722; <span style="font-size: 14px"><i>(Python)</i></span></h5> 
					I love a good Costco deal and now with two kids under two - one who sometimes eats the same amount as me - I figured it would be a good idea to make a Costco sale tracker for specific items I may want. So I made a web scraper for the coupons section of Costco, that pulls the coupon information and searches for keywords, using my previous learnings of web scraping combined with Selenium. The second part of this project involved scraping Real Canadian Superstore for the same items that were scraped from Costco and pulling prices. Then there was a price comparison done between Costco and Real Canadian Superstore to see which store is cheaper and by how much.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="schoolboard.html" class="saymore">School boards</a> &#127979; <span style="font-size: 14px"><i>(SQL)</i></span></h5> 
					As a teacher it is impossible to not pull trends occurring in your class and extrapolate it, even though it is a small sample size. Oftentimes we don’t use data to check if our feelings are correct but I found an open source dataset from the Ontario government that looks at the school boards across Ontario and their reading EQAO/OSSLT for 2018/2019, four- and five-year graduation rates and compares progress in each category since 2017/2018. Interestingly, they do not include the math results (missing both grade 6 and 9). So I jumped on the opportunity to try to answer some questions I had. I used BigQuery to query the data and Looker Studio to create a dashboard.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="website.html" class="saymore">Website</a> &#128421;&#65039; <span style="font-size: 14px"><i>(HTML/CSS)</i></span></h5> 
					I created this website using a template and then modified the pages to have the layout I wanted. I also included Google Analystics tracking and modified the code to be able to find out timeframes of how long someone spends on each page.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="indeed.html" class="saymore">Indeed</a> &#128188; <span style="font-size: 14px"><i>(Python)</i></span></h5> 
					I used a guideline that scraped the Monster job website and made my own web scraper for specific job search on Indeed.ca. This was my second project using Python. It uses BeautifulSoup and requests libraries.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="imdb.html" class="saymore">IMDb</a> &#127909; <span style="font-size: 14px"><i>(Python)</i></span></h5> 
					I used a guideline that walked me through scraping IMDb top 100 movies and creating a data frame along with saving it to a CSV file. It uses BeautifulSoup, requests, and Pandas libraries.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5><a href="hangman.html" class="saymore">Hangman</a> &#128377;&#65039; <span style="font-size: 14px"><i>(Python)</i></span></h5>
					my very first Python project was making a hangman game.

				I earned a Bachelor of Honours in Mathematics from Carleton University, where I learnt Java and C. But, I didn’t find my passion for coding - until I started learning Python near the end of my second pregnancy. As a math and science teacher to students at an alternate high school, I was curiously looking at coding courses available to them that could help teach them practical skills that could help them in the future. Because I couldn’t find any good options, I decided to start teaching myself Python to offer my students more options. I found myself getting further and further into coding and found myself falling down rabbit holes where I just kept learning more, and I really enjoyed tapping into the problem solving skills I learned in my degree. During my second maternity leave, while my two kids slept, I kept coding and expanding my projects and this website shows my journey. I would love to now try to take my skills and my love of learning and bring actionable change to a company whose values I strongly support!
