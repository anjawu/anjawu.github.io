			 During my coding journey I had begun documenting how I was learning stuff as I was doing projects and research. Most of the projects I have done thus far have been about web scraping and data analysis. So this website will primarily be about using Python. This webpage contains what I have learnt - written in a way that was supposed to help me learn and reflect on my learning. So there are definitely better resources out there in terms of getting completed code faster, as I often go on tangents about errors I had to try to solve for and research I had to do to complete a project. I link to a lot of good resources from the people I have learnt from.

		<h5>Coding Information</h5>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li><a href="github.html" class="saymore">GitHub</a> - is such a good way to store your code and share it, but it seemed overwhelming to me when I first started, so I wrote down stuff I had to learn while doing it.</li>
			<li><a href="libraries.html" class="saymore">Libraries</a> - Python has a LOT of libraries, so what I have done is write about the ones I have used extensively so far.</li>
			<li><a href="versus.html" class="saymore">Versus</a> - Like with learning new languages (yes, I am applying logic of languages to programming languages) there are plenty of words that seem similar but are different and you mix up for whatever reason, this is what this section is for me. I look at terms that seem to be used interchangeably and I just couldn’t keep straight.</li>
			<li><a href="funlearn.html" class="saymore">Fun Things Learnt</a>  - learning is always so much fun and there is always so much new information, it can be hard to not travel down rabbit holes while researching. So I decided to make this section for two main reasons: 1) I wanted to write down new things that I had learnt that I haven’t had a chance to try out in one of my big projects and 2) By having to type out what I learnt it prevented me from going down too many rabbit holes and really zeroing in on what I was trying to figure out.</li>
			<li><a href="environmentsetup.html" class="saymore">Environment Setup</a> - setting up your code editor and terminal is all about choosing your own style and making sure you have it set up in a way that is conducive to your programming habits. In this section, I go over how I set mine up to give a starting point.</li>
			<li><a href="terminalbasics.html" class="saymore">Terminal Basics</a> - each time I learnt a new terminal command I wrote it down so I wouldn’t forget.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="six columns">
		<h5>Projects</h5>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li><a href="redlight.html" class="saymore">Redlight</a> - (this project is currently underway) When I was driving into downtown for work during the later part of COVID I noticed that the traffic still seemed to be a lot lighter than before. So I was curious what has changed on the roads. When I looked on the City of Ottawa open source data, I got very excited to see that they have data from red light violations from 2016-2020. So I used the open source red light camera violations from the City of Ottawa website to do an in-depth analysis of when and where the highest number of violations occur in order to give suggestions on next steps for the City of Ottawa planning new redlight traffic lights.</li>
			<li><a href="costco.html" class="saymore">Costco</a> - I love a good Costco deal and now with two kids under two - one who sometimes eats the same amount as me - I figured it would be a good idea to make a Costco sale tracker for specific items I may want. So I made a web scraper for the coupons section of Costco, that pulls the coupon information and searches for keywords, using my previous learnings of web scraping combined with Selenium.</li>
			<li><a href="website.html" class="saymore">Website</a> - I created this website using a template and then modified the pages to have the layout I wanted.</li>
			<li><a href="indeed.html" class="saymore">Indeed</a> - I used a guideline that scraped the Monster job website and made my own web scraper for specific job search on Indeed.ca. This was my second project using Python. It uses BeautifulSoup and requests libraries.</li>
			<li><a href="imdb.html" class="saymore">IMDb</a> - I used a guideline that walked me through scraping IMDb top 100 movies and creating a data frame along with saving it to a CSV file. It uses BeautifulSoup, requests, and Pandas libraries.</li>
			<li><a href="hangman.html" class="saymore">Hangman</a> - my very first Python project was making a hangman game.</li>

			<h5 class="left">Anja Wu </h5>

				I earned a Bachelor of Honours in Mathematics from Carleton University, where I learnt Java and C. But, I didn’t find my passion for coding - until I started learning Python near the end of my second pregnancy. As a math and science teacher to students at an alternate high school, I was curiously looking at coding courses available to them that could help teach them practical skills that could help them in the future. I decided to start teaching myself Python as I couldn’t find any good options and I wanted to offer my students more options, as alternate high schools allow for more flexibility. I found myself getting further and further into coding and found myself falling down rabbit holes where I just kept learning more, and I really enjoyed tapping into the problem solving skills I learned in my degree. During my second maternity leave, while my two kids slept, I kept coding and expanding my projects and this website shows my journey.
